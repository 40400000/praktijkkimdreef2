# UI Improvements Summary

## 1. ✅ Disabled Email Invitations to Clients

**Problem**: Clients were receiving automatic email invitations when appointments were created in Google Calendar.

**Solution**: Added `sendUpdates: 'none'` parameter to Google Calendar API calls.

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/google-calendar/events.ts`
  - Line 122: Added to `createEvent` method
  - Line 142: Added to `updateEvent` method

**Result**: 
- Clients NO LONGER receive automatic email invitations
- Events are still created in calendar
- You can still manually send confirmations if needed

## 2. ✅ Full-Screen Success Message

**Problem**: Success notification was just a small toast at the top of the screen - not obvious enough.

**Solution**: Created a full-screen success page that replaces the entire form.

**Files Modified**:
- `components/appointment-booking.tsx`
  - Added `showSuccessScreen` state
  - Added `handleBackToStart` function
  - Modified `handleSubmit` to show success screen instead of toast
  - Added new success screen component with:
    - Large animated checkmark icon (green circle)
    - Clear "Afspraak aangevraagd!" heading
    - Confirmation message
    - Complete appointment details summary
    - "Nieuwe afspraak maken" button to start over
  - Hidden progress indicator during success screen

**Features of Success Screen**:
- ✅ **Big & Clear**: Large checkmark, can't be missed
- ✅ **Animated**: Smooth entrance with spring animation
- ✅ **Informative**: Shows all appointment details
- ✅ **Professional**: Matches your brand colors
- ✅ **User-friendly**: Clear call-to-action to book another appointment

**Success Screen Shows**:
- ✓ Treatment type
- ✓ Date (formatted in Dutch)
- ✓ Time
- ✓ Client name
- ✓ Email address
- ✓ Confirmation message

## Technical Details

### Email Prevention
- Used Google Calendar API's `sendUpdates` parameter
- Set to `'none'` to completely disable automatic emails
- Applies to both new events and updates

### Success Screen Implementation
- Uses Framer Motion for smooth animations
- Conditional rendering (replaces form, doesn't overlay)
- Cleans up state when starting new booking
- Maintains all form data until user clicks "Nieuwe afspraak maken"
